# Vocab-CLI
Vokatrainer CLI is a terminal-based vocabulary training program written in Python. It loads vocabulary or irregular English verbs from CSV files and quizzes them in batches of 20. Incorrect answers are reinserted later in the session, following a flashcard-style spaced repetition principle. The program is lightweight, fast to start, and requires no external libraries.

The repository contains the Python script `trainer.py` as well as two example files, `Verben_test.csv` and `Vokabel_test.csv`. The trainer supports two learning modes: standard vocabulary (for example German to English or French) and irregular English verbs with base form, simple past, and past participle. At startup, users can configure settings such as case sensitivity, typo tolerance, question order, batch size, and how wrong answers are repeated. CSV files are selected using an arrow-key menu directly in the terminal. During a learning session, intuitive commands are available, including `:q`, `:exit`, or `:menu` to leave the session, `:skip` to skip a card, `:show` to reveal the solution (counted as wrong), and `?` to display all available commands.

Installation is straightforward on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The only requirement is Python 3.9 or newer. On Linux and macOS, the program can be started by cloning the repository, navigating into the project directory, and running `python3 trainer.py`. On Windows, Python can be installed from python.org (with “Add Python to PATH” enabled), after which the script can be started using `python trainer.py` from Command Prompt or PowerShell. No additional dependencies need to be installed.

Vocabulary files are simple UTF-8 encoded CSV files using semicolons as separators. For vocabulary training, the expected format is `de;en` or `de;fr`. For irregular verbs, the format is `de;base;past;pp`. Multiple correct answers can be provided by separating them with a vertical bar (`|`). All CSV files should be placed in the same directory as `trainer.py` so they can be selected from the built-in menu.

CSV vocabulary files can also be created automatically from photos of vocabulary sheets using ChatGPT. By uploading a clear image of a worksheet and asking ChatGPT to extract the vocabulary into a semicolon-separated CSV file with the correct header, ready-to-use vocabulary files can be generated quickly. These files can then be saved with a `.csv` extension and placed next to the Python script for immediate use in the trainer.
